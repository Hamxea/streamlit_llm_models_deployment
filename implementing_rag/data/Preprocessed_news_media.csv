And then mostly just for playing in the street. Jørgine finds the lack of activity frightening. - Especially for children who will grow up in a society where there are no requirements for physical activity"

Research proves benefits of HIIT
Dr Keech said the benefits of HIIT had become clearer in recent years with accumulating research showing it was effective for improving aerobic fitness and cardiovascular-related health indicators, such as blood pressure, body fat levels and glucose control.
“In my main area of expertise – cardiac benefits – it was a seminal study in 2007 by Ulrik Wisloff, a leading Norwegian exercise scientist, that applied HIIT successfully to cardiac rehab patients with an average age of 75 years that started the ball rolling in HIIT research,” he said.

You don’t need to be fit to start HIIT
Even if you rarely exercise, it’s never too late to start doing HIIT, Dr Keech said.
“When you get fitter, you lower your risk of early mortality and this is especially important for those who have not exercised much in their life – you can get great benefit from starting regular exercise,” he said.
“For people who are generally healthy but otherwise sedentary, start conservatively with MICT and then gradually build HIIT into the program – either form of training will deliver improvements in aerobic fitness within the first few weeks.
“This is largely from increases in blood volume because having more blood in your body leads to more oxygen reaching your working muscles, but these benefits will be lost if you give up regular exercise.”
Dr Keech said people with chronic disease could also benefit from HIIT – as long as they had adequate supervision and guidance.
“HIIT has been applied in a wide range of chronic illness populations in the past few years – such as people who have survived stroke or have kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or cancer,” he said.
“We use HIIT with cardiac rehab patients in Prince of Wales Hospital with strict safeguards – pre-training heart health screening with a cardiologist, regular checking of blood pressure and symptoms, strict adherence to the prescribed exercise program – and in this setting it has been shown to be relatively safe.
“We are now designing a study that will investigate the feasibility of HIIT in patients with severe liver disease at St George Hospital.”
Watch your waistline – not your weight
Dr Keech said one of his studies, a meta-analysis, showed HIIT and MICT both led to, on average, about two kilograms of fat loss after about 10 weeks of training, three times a week – without any dietary change.
“Fat loss through exercise is not accompanied by any great weight loss because you lose fat but can gain weight via other means",55,5,"Multiple meta-analyses studies have shown HIIT is more effective than MICT for improving glucose control and insulin sensitivity, so it is especially good for lowering diabetic risk.” You don’t need to be fit to start HIIT Even if you rarely exercise, it’s never too late to start doing HIIT, . “When you get fitter, you lower your risk of early mortality and this is especially important for those who have not exercised much in their life – you can get great benefit from starting regular exercise,” he said. “For people who are generally healthy but otherwise sedentary, start conservatively with MICT and then gradually build HIIT into the program – either form of training will deliver improvements in aerobic fitness within the first few weeks. “This is largely from increases in blood volume because having more blood in your body leads to more oxygen reaching your working muscles, but these benefits will be lost if you give up regular exercise.” people with chronic disease could also benefit from HIIT – as long as they had adequate supervision and guidance. “HIIT has been applied in a wide range of chronic illness populations in the past few years – such as people who have survived stroke or have kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or cancer,” he said. “We use HIIT with cardiac rehab patients in Prince of strict safeguards – pre-training heart health screening with a cardiologist, regular checking of blood pressure and symptoms, strict adherence to the prescribed exercise program – and in this setting it has been shown to be relatively safe. “We are now designing a study that will investigate the feasibility of HIIT in patients with severe liver disease at .” Watch your waistline – not your weight one of his studies, a meta-analysis, showed HIIT and MICT both led to, on average, about two kilograms of fat loss after about 10 weeks of training, three times a week – without any dietary change. “Fat loss through exercise is not accompanied by any great weight loss because you lose fat but can gain weight via other means"

“This can increase your body weight by half a kilo or so – initially it’s from water retention leading to plasma increases, then the kidneys detect this change and start the process to pump out more red blood cells.”
Dr Keech said people should therefore not rely on weight loss to evaluate the benefits of exercise, including HIIT.
“Waist circumference is likely a better index of exercise-induced fat loss, which is an under-appreciated point in the community,” he said.
“Most of us just use body weight scales at home and see little change after many weeks or months of training",55,6,"An increase in muscle mass occurs a little bit, but it also comes from blood volume increases,” he said. “This can increase your body weight by half a kilo or so – initially it’s from water retention leading to plasma increases, then the kidneys detect this change and start the process to pump out more red blood cells.” people should therefore not rely on weight loss to evaluate the benefits of exercise, including HIIT. “Waist circumference is likely a better index of exercise-induced fat loss, which is an under-appreciated point in the community,” he said. “Most of us just use body weight scales at home and see little change after many weeks or months of training"

Give HIIT a go
Dr Keech said the cardiac patients he worked with enjoyed a big confidence boost from doing HIIT – knowing they could safely exert themselves after surviving a heart attack – so, it could help many other people keep fit, too.
“HIIT is not a passing fad – it is a genuine intervention with a range of advantages over MICT, including time-efficiency, enjoyment and the challenge of mastering a concentrated form of exercise,” he said.
“If you design a HIIT program thoughtfully – for example, with shorter bursts or longer rest periods and build up gradually – you can limit the sense of discomfort or fatigue that many people find unappealing about exercise.
“Remember, the human body likes to work hard and while results from exercise vary across individuals, HIIT can encourage positive changes that improve health and ultimately, lower the risk of an early death.”

PAI measures all physical activity that causes the heart rate to increase above a certain level. The higher the heart rate, the faster you earn PAI points.
The PAI algorithm calculates a weekly score based on your personal profile and variations in heart rate throughout the period. The PAI score can, for example, be easily measured with the free PAI Health app for both iPhone and Android.

The researchers believed that the results could be used to tailor the training to each individual. Physiology professor Jostein Hallén believed that it was not that simple, at least for now:

Historic Kenyan victory in Sierre-Zinal when Kilian Jornet was beaten
Many of the world's best mountain runners took part in this year's edition of the 31 km long Swiss mountain race Sierre-Zinal. The race is part of the Golden Trail World Series and the trail has an ascent of 2,200 meters and a drop of 1,100 meters. Kilian Jornet has won the race seven times previously and in 2019 set a course record with a time of 2.25.36.
This time, however, the Norwegian mountain king had to settle for 5th place. For the first time in history, there was a Kenyan victory in the mountain race.

READ MORE: New study: Being poorly trained is more dangerous than smoking The researchers have measured the fitness level of over 4,500 Norwegian women and men, and see a clear trend: The better the fitness level, the lower the risk of heart attack and angina pectoris. - Even among people who are apparently healthy, the quarter with the best condition actually only has half as high a risk as the quarter with the worst condition, says researcher Nes to Gemini. Had a low risk in the first place NTNU researchers in CERG (Group) have measured the fitness level of 4,527 women and men who all participated in the third health survey in Nord-Trøndelag (HUNT) in the period 2006 to 2008.

Those who trained with HIIT had significantly higher fitness and a better quality of life compared to control and MICT, says Stensvold. - How do you explain that the mortality in the moderate group was higher, even though this was not statistically significant? - All three groups have a lower mortality rate than is expected for this age group in general.

But we also see that there are more people in the control group who train with high intensity - than among those in the moderate group, so perhaps some of the explanation lies there. The moderate group and the control group otherwise follow each other in fitness and quality of life.
In the study, the results in the main analysis are combined, which may affect the survival figures. Stensvold explains this as follows:
